# Known issues
1. The issue if where you bleep 2 times during it's cooldown, and you post after it had cool down, that the post before you post after the cool down will also get sent with it (I can't fix this. This has been bugging me since it's creation and I've been desperately trying to fix it. I'm going insane. Please someone just make a pull request that fixes this issue so I don't have to be tormented by this dumb programming language anymore.)
